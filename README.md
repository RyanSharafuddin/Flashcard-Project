# Flashcard-Project
This program was made to help a friend study for an American Sign Language class. It acts as a word to video flashcard program. More details can be found in the README.
This reads in a text file of words and a text file of the locations of videos of the friend doing the sign language for the words and creates a list of tuples - each tuple has a word as its first element and the corresponding video location as its second element. The program then randomizes the order of the list and displays the words. When "show sign" is clicked, it plays the corresponding video. When "Next" is clicked, the next word is displayed. In the future, this program will include options to display the video first, then the word, the option to divide words into units and then only study a specific subset of units, and the option to display images instead of words (for example, a picture triangle instead of the word "triangle").
